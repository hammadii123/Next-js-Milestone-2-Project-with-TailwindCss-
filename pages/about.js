            My skill set extends to Python, where I specialize in advanced data
            structures and problem-solving techniques. Currently, I am expanding
            my knowledge in the field of Generative AI through an intensive
            program at GIAC, developing innovative solutions that drive value in
            dynamic environments.

            Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and collaborating with
            forward-thinking teams to create impactful projects. I look forward
            to connecting and discussing how my expertise can contribute to
            ambitious projects.
